# Bluenet protocol v0.10.0
-------------------------

# <a name="encryption"></a>Encryption
By default, Crownstones have encryption enabled as a security and privacy measure.


### Setup mode
When a Crownstone is new or factory reset, it will go into setup mode.

Setup mode turns down the power of the antenna (low TX) so you can only communicate with it when you're close by. The purpose of this mode
is to configure the Crownstone so only you, or people in your group, can communicate with it.

The protocol here is as follows:

1. Crownstone is in setup mode (low TX, [Setup Service active](#setup_service))
- Phone is close and connects to the Crownstone
- Phone reads the Crownstone [MAC address](#setup_service) (required for iOS). This characteristic is not encrypted.
- Phone reads the session key and session nonce from the [setup service](#setup_service). These characteristics are not encrypted.
The values are only valid for this connection session. The session key and the session nonce will be used to encrypt the rest of the setup phase using AES 128 CTR as explained [here](#encrypted_write_read).
- Phone starts setting up the Crownstone using the [config control](#setup_service) characteristic
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its identifier](#crownstone_identifier)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Admin key](#admin_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the User key](#user_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Guest key](#guest_key)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [the Mesh Access Address](#mesh_access_address)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon UUID](#ibeacon_uuid)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon Major](#ibeacon_major)
    - Phone gives Crownstone [its iBeacon Minor](#ibeacon_minor)
- Phone commands Crownstone [to leave setup mode](#validate_setup)


### Using encryption after setup (normal mode)

When encryption is enabled the following changes:

- The [scan response packet service data](#scan_response_servicedata_packet) will be encrypted using the Guest key.
- Values that are **read from** the characteristics will be encrypted
- Values that are **written to** the characteristics will have to be encrypted

#### <a name="session_nonce"></a>Session nonce

After connecting, you first have to read the session nonce from the [Crownstone service](#crownstone_service). The session nonce is [ECB encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29) with the guest key. After decryption, you should verify whether you have read and decrypted succesfully by checking if the validation key in the [data](#encrypted_session_nonce) is equal to **0xCAFEBABE**. If so, you now have the correct session nonce.

The session nonce has two purposes:
- Validation: the first 4 bytes of the session nonce is what we call the validation key, it is used for any [encrypted packet](#encrypted_packet).
- Encryption: the whole 5 bytes are used for the nonce, which is used for CTR encryption. The first 3 bytes of the nonce are the packet nonce (which should be randomly generated each time you write to a characteristic), the last 5 are the session nonce.
The session nonce and validation key are only valid during the connection.

##### <a name="encrypted_session_nonce"></a>Session nonce after ECB decryption
Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint 32 | Validation key | 4 | 0xCAFEBABE as validation.
byte array | Session nonce | 5 | The session nonce for this session.
byte array | Padding | 7 | Zero-padding so that the whole packet is 16 bytes.


### <a name="encrypted_write_read"></a>Reading and writing characteristics

We use the [AES 128 CTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_.28CTR.29) method to encrypt everything that is written to- and read from characteristics. For this you need an 8 byte number called a **nonce**. The first 3 bytes of the nonce are sent with each packet, we call this the packet nonce. When writing to a characteristic, you should generate a new random packet nonce each time. The last 5 bytes of the nonce are called the session nonce, which should be read after connecting. When reading a characteristic, you should check if the (decrypted) validation key is equal to the validation key that was read [after connecting](#session_nonce).

# Advertisements and scan response
When no device is connected, [advertisements](#ibeacon_packet) will be sent at a regular interval (100ms by default). A device that actively scans, will also receive a [scan response packet](#scan_response_packet). This contains useful info about the state.


### <a name="ibeacon_packet"></a>iBeacon advertisement packet
This packet is according to iBeacon spec, see for example [here](http://www.havlena.net/en/location-technologies/ibeacons-how-do-they-technically-work/).

### <a name="scan_response_servicedata_packet"></a>Scan response service data packet
This packet contains the state info. If encryption is enabled, the last 16 bytes will be encrypted using [AES 128 ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29) using the guest key.
You receive a MAC address on Android and an UUID on iOS for each advertisement packet. This allows you to get the Crownstone ID associated with the packet and you verify the decryption by checking the expected Crownstone ID against the one in the packet.

the following layout

Bit 7 is used for the relay flag, where 0 = OFF, 1 = ON.
Bits 6-0 are used for PWM, where 100 is fully ON, 0 is OFF, dimmed in between.

## <a name="crownstone_service"></a>Crownstone service

The crownstone service has UUID 24f00000-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff and provides all the functionality of the Crownstone through the following services

##### <a name="recovery"></a>Recovery
If you lose your encryption keys you can use this characteristic to factory reset the Crownstone.
This method is only available for 20 seconds after the Crownstone powers on.
You need to write **0xDEADBEEF** to it. After this, the Crownstone disconnects and goes into Low TX mode so you'll have to be close to continue the factory reset. After this, you reconnect and write **0xDEADBEEF** again to this characteristic to factory reset the Crownstone.

##### <a name="return_values"></a>Return values
The control characteristics (Control, Mesh Control, Config Control and State Control) of the Crownstone service return a uint16 code on execution of the command.
The code determines success or failure of the command. If commands have to be executed sequentially, make sure that the return value of the previous command
was received before calling the next (either by polling or subscribing). The possible values of the return values are listed in the table below

Value | Name | Description
